# balanced-line
Reworking of an old production-line simulator

Based loosely on the dice game described in Eli Goldratt's "The Goal", 
this version can compare a "perfect" line (no variation in processes)
with the more realistic case of random variation in units processed.

The simulation runs for 400 time units (ticks) and compares performance of various simulated production lines.
